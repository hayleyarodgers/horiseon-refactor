# usyd-bootcamp-challenge-week1

## Description

My primary goal for this project was to refactor code I was given from an existing website (Horiseon) so that it follows accessibility standards. Ensuring that a website meets accessibility standards is beneficial because it ensures that a website's content is correctly understood by search engines and assistive technologies such as screen readers. 

To achieve this, I replaced non-semantic HTML elements with semantic elements and added alt text to images. I also re-organised, consolidated and commented on the code to make it easier for other developers to use in the future. 

This ultimately improved the accessibility of the site, whilst keeping its appearance the same (as shown below).

During this project, I consolidated my understanding of HTML and CSS and learnt about:
- The difference between semantic and non-semantic elements 
- The importance of using semantic elements
- Commenting on HTML and CSS
- Writing a README file
- And, deploying an application using Github Pages.

## Credits

This is the [starter code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram) that I refactored from [Xandromus](https://github.com/Xandromus/Xandromus).

This is the [guide](https://perishablepress.com/obsessive-css-code-formatting-organization-comments-and-signatures/) I used to add comments to the CSS file.

This is the [guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) I used to write this README file.
