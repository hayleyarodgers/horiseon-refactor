# usyd-bootcamp-challenge-week1

## Description

My primary goal for this project was to refactor code I was given from an existing website (Horiseon) so that it follows accessibility standards. Ensuring that a website meets accessibility standards is beneficial because it ensures that a website's content is correctly understood by search engines and assistive technologies such as screen readers.

This project involved:
- Replacing non-semantic HTML elements with semantic elements
- And, adding alt text to images (except those that were purely decorative).
I also re-organised, consolidated and commented on the code to make it easier to use in the future. 

During this project, I consolidated my understanding of HTML and CSS and learnt about:
- Semantic vs non-semantic elements and the importance of using semantic elements
- Commenting on HTML and CSS
- Writing a README file
- And, deploying an application.
